## Introduction

Across the Internet, every website and app you use depends on one simple thing:
**communication between your computer and a server.** Computers are constantly talking to each other. Usually, you see this happening through a web browser like Chrome. But as a developer, you often need to talk to servers directly without a fancy interface. This is where cURL comes in.

## What is cURL?

cURL stands for "Client URL" and is a tool that allows you to interact with web servers and APIs directly from the command line. It is widely used for testing endpoints, downloading files, and automating web requests.
