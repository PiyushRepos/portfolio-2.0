Before Git, before GitHub, before cloud platforms…
There was confusion.

Not about _how to write code_,
But about **which code was the correct one**?

If you’ve ever seen files named like:

- `project_final`

- `project_final_v2`

- `project_final_v3`

- `project_final_latest`

- `project_final_latest_updated`

Then you already understand the problem.

Version control exists because developers needed a way to **stop losing work**, **stop overwriting each other’s code**, and **work together without fear**.

## The Pendrive Analogy in Software Development

Let’s go back to a time before modern tools.

No Git.
No GitHub.
No shared repositories.

Just:

- Pendrives

- Emails

- Local folders

- Trust issues

### A very common workflow back then

1. The developer writes some code

2. Copy it to a pendrive

3. Hand it to Developer B

4. Developer B modifies the code

5. Someone forgets which version is the latest

6. Everything breaks

This approach worked only when:

- There was **one developer**

- Or the project was **very small**

The moment teams grew, problems started showing up.

## The Famous “Final” Folder System

Every developer had folders like this:

```plaintext
project/
 ├─ final/
 ├─ final_v2/
 ├─ final_v3/
 ├─ final_latest/
 ├─ final_latest_please_work/
```

Each folder looked important.
None of them was trustworthy.

You could never answer questions like:

- Which file is the latest?

- What changed since yesterday?

- Who modified this line?

This wasn’t laziness.
This was the **absence of a system**.

## Problems Faced Before Version Control Systems

### 1\. Code Was Accidentally Overwritten

Two developers edited the same file.

One copied their version last.

The other person’s work?

Gone.
No history.
No undo button.

### 2\. Changes Were Lost Forever

If something broke, you couldn’t go back and check:

- What the code looked like yesterday

- When a bug was introduced

- Why was a change made

Once overwritten, the old version **ceased to exist**.

### 3\. No Collaboration History

If a bug appeared, questions followed:

- Who wrote this code?

- When was it added?

- Why was it changed?

Most of the time, the answer was silence.

There was **no accountability**, not because people were careless, but because the system didn’t support it.

### 4\. Team Collaboration Was Painful

Now imagine:

- 3–5 developers

- Same project

- Same files

- Different copies of code

Everyone was working hard,
Yet everything felt fragile.

One wrong copy-paste could break the entire project.

## The Real-World Team Problem

As software teams grew, this problem became serious.

Companies needed:

- Multiple developers working together

- Safe collaboration

- A clear history of changes

- A way to recover from mistakes

Pendrives, emails, and folder naming conventions were never designed for this.

So the question became:

> How do we let many people work on the same code without destroying each other’s work?

## Why Version Control Became Mandatory

Version control systems were created to solve this exact problem.

Instead of manually sharing files, developers now had:

- A **single source of truth**

- Automatic tracking of changes

- A complete history of the project

- Safe ways to combine work from multiple people

Every change is:

- Recorded

- Traceable

- Reversible

Nothing disappears silently.

## Pendrive Workflow vs Version Control Workflow

| Pendrive / Email Workflow | Version Control Workflow |
| ------------------------- | ------------------------ |
| Manual file sharing       | Central repository       |
| Files get overwritten     | Changes are tracked      |
| No history                | Full change history      |
| Hard collaboration        | Team-friendly            |
| High risk                 | Controlled and safe      |

## Connecting This to Git

Git may feel confusing at first.

Commands.
Commits.
Branches.
Merges.

But Git didn’t make development complicated.
It **organised problems that already existed**.

Every Git feature exists because something used to go wrong:

- Commits exist because changes were getting lost

- History exists because teams needed visibility

- Branches exist because working on the same code was risky

- Merging exists because collaboration had to be safe

When you understand the **pendrive problem**, Git starts to feel less intimidating and more logical.

## Final Thoughts

Version control is not about tools.
It’s about **protecting work**.

It exists because:

- Pendrives failed

- Emails failed

- “final_v3_latest” failed

Version control became essential because modern software development **cannot survive without collaboration**.

And collaboration without history, safety, and trust simply doesn’t work.

That’s why version control exists.
